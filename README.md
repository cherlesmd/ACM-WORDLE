## Brief
This repository contains files for the ACM Beginners' Workshop Project: A Wordle Game. It will be written using Java SE 18 and the classic Swing GUI framework, and it will implement part of the features on this [implementation](https://wordlegame.org/).

## Tentative Feature List
 1. Basic wordle functionality: 6 tries to guess a word, highlight incorrect, included, or correct letters as gray, yellow, or green.
 2. Extra features for fun:
    - Game settings such as word length.
    - Show, clear, or save stats.
